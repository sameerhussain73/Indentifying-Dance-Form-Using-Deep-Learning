**Indian Dance Classification**

**Project Description**

This repository is dedicated to the development of a machine learning model for classifying different styles of Indian dance. Using image processing and classification techniques, the project aims to accurately identify various Indian dance forms from images.

**Dataset**

The dataset for this project comprises a collection of images representing various Indian dance styles. Each image is labeled with the corresponding dance form, providing a diverse and comprehensive dataset for training and testing the model.

**Approach**

**Data Preprocessing:**

**Image Processing:** Adjusting image sizes and formats to create a uniform dataset.

**Data Augmentation:** Enhancing the dataset through techniques like rotation and scaling to improve model robustness.

**Model Building:**

**Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** Constructing a CNN model tailored to recognize unique features of different dance styles.

**Training and Validation:** Iteratively training the model with both training and validation datasets to fine-tune its accuracy and generalization.

**Model Evaluation:**

**Performance Metrics:** Utilizing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's effectiveness in dance classification.

**Results**

The developed model showcases its ability to classify Indian dance forms with significant accuracy, demonstrating the potential of machine learning in cultural and artistic contexts.

**Tools and Technologies**

**Python:** Main programming language used in the project.

**TensorFlow/Keras:** For constructing and training the neural network.

**OpenCV:** Employed for image processing tasks.

**Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Used for visualizing data and results.

**Usage**

Complete instructions for setting up the project, processing the images, training the classifier, and evaluating its performance are provided. Users can follow these to replicate the study, adjust model parameters, and explore the classifier's application in various fields.
